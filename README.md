**Segment and Track Anything** is an open-source project that focuses on the segmentation and tracking of any objects in videos, utilizing both automatic and interactive methods. The primary algorithms utilized include the [**SAM** (Segment Anything Models)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) for automatic/interactive key-frame segmentation and the [**DeAOT** (Decoupling features in Associating Objects with Transformers)](https://github.com/yoxu515/aot-benchmark) (NeurIPS2022) for efficient multi-object tracking and propagation. The SAM-Track pipeline enables dynamic and automatic detection and segmentation of new objects by SAM, while DeAOT is responsible for tracking all identified objects.

## :loudspeaker:New Features
- [2024/4/23] We have added an audio-grounding feature that tracks the sound-making object within the video's soundtrack.
- [2023/5/12] We have authored a technical report for SAM-Track.
- [2023/5/7] We have added `demo_instseg.ipynb`, which uses Grounding-DINO to detect new objects in the key frames of a video. It can be applied in the fields of smart cities and autonomous driving.
- [2023/4/29] We have added advanced arguments for AOT-L: `long_term_memory_gap` and `max_len_long_term`.
   - `long_term_memory_gap` controls the frequency at which the AOT model adds new reference frames to its long-term memory. During mask propagation, AOT matches the current frame with the reference frames stored in the long-term memory. 
   - Setting the gap value to a proper value helps to obtain better performance. To avoid memory explosion in long videos, we set a `max_len_long_term` value for the long-term memory storage, i.e. when the number of memory frames reaches the `max_len_long_term value`, the oldest memory frame will be discarded and a new frame will be added.

- [2023/4/26] **Interactive WebUI 1.5-Version**: We have added new features based on Interactive WebUI-1.0 Version.
   - We have added a new form of interactivity—text prompts—to SAMTrack.
   - From now on, multiple objects that need to be tracked can be interactively added.
   - Check out [tutorial](./tutorial/tutorial%20for%20WebUI-1.5-Version.md) for Interactive WebUI 1.5-Version. More demos will be released in the next few days.
- [2023/4/26] **Image-Sequence input**: The WebUI now has a new feature that allows for input of image sequences, which can be used to test video segmentation datasets. Get started with the [tutorial](./tutorial/tutorial%20for%20Image-Sequence%20input.md) for Image-Sequence input. 
- [2023/4/25] **Online Demo:** You can easily use SAMTrack in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R10N70AJaslzADFqb-a5OihYkllWEVxB?usp=sharing) for visual tracking tasks.

- [2023/4/23] **Interactive WebUI:** We have introduced a new WebUI that allows interactive user segmentation through strokes and clicks. Feel free to explore and have fun with the [tutorial](./tutorial/tutorial%20for%20WebUI-1.0-Version.md)!

## :computer:Getting Started
### :bookmark_tabs:Requirements

The [Segment-Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) repository has been cloned and renamed as sam, and the [aot-benchmark](https://github.com/yoxu515/aot-benchmark) repository has been cloned and renamed as aot.

Please check the dependency requirements in [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [DeAOT](https://github.com/yoxu515/aot-benchmark).

The implementation is tested under python 3.9, as well as pytorch 1.10 and torchvision 0.11. **We recommend equivalent or higher pytorch version**.

Use the `install.sh` to install the necessary libs for SAM-Track
```
bash script/install.sh
```

### :star:Model Preparation
Download SAM model to ckpt, the default model is SAM-VIT-B ([sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)).

Download DeAOT/AOT model to ckpt, the default model is R50-DeAOT-L ([R50_DeAOTL_PRE_YTB_DAV.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QoChMkTVxdYZ_eBlZhK2acq9KMQZccPJ/view)).

Download Grounding-Dino model to ckpt, the default model is GroundingDINO-T ([groundingdino_swint_ogc](https://huggingface.co/ShilongLiu/GroundingDINO/resolve/main/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth)).

Download AST model to ast_master/pretrained_models, the default model is audioset_0.4593 ([audioset_0.4593.pth]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/cv4knew8mvbrnvq/audioset_0.4593.pth?dl=1)).

You can download the default weights using the command line as shown below.
```
bash script/download_ckpt.sh
```

Create a ckpt folder in the root directory and put the downloaded model up into ckpt





### video

- The video to be processed can be put in ./assets. 
- Then run **demo.ipynb** step by step to generate results. 
- The results will be saved as masks for each frame and a gif file for visualization.

The arguments for SAM-Track, DeAOT and SAM can be manually modified in model_args.py for purpose of using other models or controling the behavior of each model.

### :muscle:WebUI App
Our user-friendly visual interface allows you to easily obtain the results of your experiments. Simply initiate it using the command line.

```
python app.py
```
Users can upload the video directly on the UI and use SegTracker to automatically/interactively track objects within that video. We use a video of a man playing basketball as an example.

![Interactive WebUI](./assets/interactive_webui.jpg)

SegTracker-Parameters:
 - **aot_model**: used to select which version of DeAOT/AOT to use for tracking and propagation.
 - **sam_gap**: used to control how often SAM is used to add newly appearing objects at specified frame intervals. Increase to decrease the frequency of discovering new targets, but significantly improve speed of inference.
 - **points_per_side**: used to control the number of points per side used for generating masks by sampling a grid over the image. Increasing the size enhances the ability to detect small objects, but larger targets may be segmented into finer granularity.
 - **max_obj_num**: used to limit the maximum number of objects that SAM-Track can detect and track. A larger number of objects necessitates a greater utilization of memory, with approximately 16GB of memory capable of processing a maximum of 255 objects.

Usage: To see the details, please refer to the [tutorial for 1.0-Version WebUI](./tutorial/tutorial%20for%20WebUI-1.0-Version.md).
